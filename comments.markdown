# Groovy Grails Comments

## Infininight

* Grammar could use a less obscure name. HTML (Groovy Grails) perhaps?
* Shouldn't more of the template tags (g:textField, etc) be marked up? (We are going to start marking up template tags with a unique scope so it would help coloring.)
* Many of the snippets seem to have tab stops in the middle of the blocks (for instance g:each), perhaps this is a bad idea since it would mean you can't use any other snippets inside that block?
* For the two simple tag creation snippets you could use the ⌃> shortcut, my ultimate goal is to make that the default shortcut for "insert embedded tag here". Take a look at how it works for erb, hit it once for a tag, and again to cycle through the tag types.
* New short tag has $4 at the end of the snippet, which means until you tab your still in the snippet.
* Many of the <g:foo> snippets are inconsistent on wether they insert a newline after the closing tag or not, should be standardized.
* Not sure about using the ⌃⇧G shortcut for all java/xml files. But allan is the expert there so I'll let him comment.
